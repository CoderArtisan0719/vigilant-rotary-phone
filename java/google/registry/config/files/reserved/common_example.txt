# Example of a reserved list file.  This is simply a CSV file with 2-3
# columns: sub-domain name and reservation type and (in the case of the
# NAMESERVER_RESTRICTED type) a colon-separated list of nameservers. See
# java/google/registry/model/registry/label/ReserverationType for the complete
# set of reservation types.
#
# These are manipulated using the "nomulus" tool
# {create,update,delete,list}_reserved_list commands.
